Once a year me and my girlfriend spend 4-5 days in Mexico with my parents.
It's a great getaway from our jobs and hectic lives.
We relax on the beach for 6-8 hours a days
Soak up the sun and listen to the waves
Go for a swim
Eat lots of tacos and quesadillas
And the missus enjoys her fair share of tropical drinks
